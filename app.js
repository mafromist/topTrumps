/*Background about the game
The game is played taking turns between one players’ hand of 15
cards and the other player’s hand. 

The cards have statistics on
them which will allow the user to pick an attribute and compare
that attribute with the other players’ top card; 
whoever has the strongest chosen attribute, wins both cards. 
If the values are the
same, both cards go into limbo and whoever wins the next hand,
wins the limbo cards and the ones just battled. The winning
player of the hand continues to choose until they lose.
